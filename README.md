### Getting started

See our [Getting Started Guide][getting-started]
if you're building your first project with Angular Material.

Check out our [directory of design documents](https://github.com/angular/material2/wiki/Design-doc-directory)
for more insight into our process.

If you'd like to contribute, you must follow our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
You can look through the issues (which should be up-to-date on who is working on which features
and which pieces are blocked) and make a comment.
Also see our [`help wanted`](https://github.com/angular/material2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
label.

High level stuff planned for Q2 2018 (April - June):
* Implementing cdk virtual-scroll
* Implementing cdk drag-and-drop
* Ongoing migration to bazel
* Table feature improvements
* Improve docs for cdk
* Accessibility improvements for select, autocomplete, button-toggle, and chips.

## The goal of Angular Material
Our goal is to build a set of high-quality UI components built with Angular and TypeScript,
following the Material Design spec. These
components will serve as an example of how to write Angular code following best practices.

### What do we mean by "high-quality"?
* Internationalized and accessible so that all users can use them.
* Straightforward APIs that don't confuse developers.
* Behave as expected across a wide variety of use-cases without bugs.
* Behavior is well-tested with both unit and integration tests.
* Customizable within the bounds of the Material Design specification.
* Performance cost is minimized.
* Code is clean and well-documented to serve as an example for Angular devs.

## Browser and screen reader support
Angular Material supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers:
Chrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and IE11 / Edge

We also aim for great user experience with the following screen readers:
* NVDA and JAWS with IE / FF / Chrome (on Windows).
* VoiceOver with Safari on iOS and Safari / Chrome on OSX.
* TalkBack with Chrome on Android.
